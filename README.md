## Introduction

KetoMe is a nutrional app designed to tailor to the needs of users on the Ketogenic diet. The app allows users to keep track of the meals that they consume on a daily basis as well as the unit count of each nutrion they consume. The app also allows users to search and add for the meals that they consume by entering keywords into the search bar.

## Functionality


Users must first signup or login before using the application. Once users are logged in they will be able to search for various meals that they consumed and add it to their meal tracker, which can be viewed on their profile. The tracker displays the nutritional values consumed for each meal, and shows a total calculated nutritional value from all the meals consumed that day.
